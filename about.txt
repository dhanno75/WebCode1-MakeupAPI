display -> display brand and name of the product, price, image and product link, description

Since the json data from the api is too large the data was taking more than 2 minutes to load the page due to which my browser got stuck and my system also got slow. The other issue was that some of the images was not loading. I raised my query in zen portal and the mentor 'Suman Gangopadhyay' assigned to me said that copy the json from the api to a local file and then use it. He said use a default image which says 'no image found' if the images is not loading.

Copying the data to the local file did not help, so I restricted the array of objects data to just 200.
